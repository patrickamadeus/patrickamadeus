### 👋 Hi, I'm Patrick

🎓 I'm a Research Engineer at [SMU 🇸🇬](https://www.smu.edu.sg), advised by Prof. Chong-Wah Ngo, working on the intersection of **multimodal** and **multilingual** learning.  
🔜 I will be pursuing PhD, focusing on **vision-language representation learning** and reasoning architectures (excl. future interests).

💡 Up until now, my research interests include:
- 🤖 **Multimodal Learning**: VLMs, alignment, efficient architectures, and multimodal RAG.
- 🌐 **Multilingual Alignment**: Low-resource language transfer and domain-specific benchmarking.
- 🧠 **Reasoning Architectures**: Efficient decoding, hallucination mitigation, and model interpretability.

🧪 Previously, I earned my CS degree at ITB 🇮🇩 under Prof. Ayu Purwarianti, working on explainable synthetic data generation.  
🛠️ I also enjoy building applied AI systems—check out some of my work below!
